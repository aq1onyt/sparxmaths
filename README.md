## **The** ***cutest*** **SparxMaths bookwork-bypass extension for Chromium ~!**

### ✩ *If you like this project, consider giving it a star!* ✩

<img src="extension/assets/divider.png">

### ♡ **How to install:**

- Go to [**Releases**](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea/releases/) > **[Latest](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea/releases/latest)** or click on **[Azalea.zip](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea/releases/latest/download/Azalea.zip)** to download the **compressed extension bundle** containing all the things to be injected into Sparx!
    <hr />
- Extract the ZIP to a folder onto your local file system.
- Open the **Manage Extensions** tab in your Chromium-based browser
  - (This can be any browser ranging from `Chrome` to `Edge` to `Opera` to `Arc` to `Orion`).
  <hr />
- *(Enable* ***Developer Mode*** *if not enabled already.)*
- Click on **Load Unpacked**.
- Select the **Azalea-(version)** directory.
  <hr />
- **You're done!** Open/Refresh `Sparx` and the extension should be installed! :D

### ♡ **Features provided by the extension:**

- Adds a simple CSS property which **allows all text to be selectable**:

    ```css
    :root {
        --user-select-accessibility-setting: default !important;
    }
    ```

- Provides access to **Themes** by going into **Menu > Settings** at the top right!
  - Currently the **themes available** include:
  - None (Default ✓), Pink, Purple, Blue, Aqua, Green, Creme, Dusk, Custom
    <hr />
  - *Note:* ***Custom themes allow you to theme every colored variable available in Azalea, ranging from tints to regular colors to text colors. This uses the colors for `Pink` by default because I advocate for pink and believe it is the best color <3.***
  <hr />

- Stores **bookwork checks** and automatically selects them if possible (this is *on* by default, and can be disabled from **Menu > Bookwork**), otherwise shows you the most recent answers to choose the correct option yourself.

- *Note:* **You can manage your stored bookwork checks by going into ***Menu > Bookwork*** at the top right**

  <hr />

- Allows you to anonymize your username by setting it to **Rosie :3** by default (editable from **Menu > Settings**, off by default). This aims to make Sparx a place where you cannot be doxxed by showing a screenshot asking for help!

  <hr />

- Allows you to change the icon used in Sparx by providing an image URL! (editable from **Menu > Settings**, off by default).

### ♡ **Notes on bundling and updating:**

- The codebase **is minified and obfuscated into a bundle**, but this is simply done to reduce file size when installing. This means that **all of the source code is public** and the codebase is transformed into a bundle using GitHub Actions, available to view [here](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea/actions).

    <hr />

- This ensures that the code is safe to use for everyone! If you don't trust me, the actions, or want to be extra sure, *which is perfectly fair enough*, **clone the repository and build the extension yourself**!

    <hr />

- Due to the limited nature of Manifest V3 Chrome Extensions, having an updater is *very* difficult and convoluted, due to Chrome's Storage APIs being too slow to load the code in time to yield React via exfiltration. As such, there is no way to update automatically. You must re-download Azalea from [releases](https://github.com/acquitelol/azalea) every time there is an update.
